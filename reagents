DMSO and Betaine Greatly Improve Amplification of GC-Rich Constructs in De Novo Synthesis
crowding reagent --- polyethylene glycol(PEG), dextran and Ficoll ; mimic cellular conditions ; 
Macromolecular crowding stabilizes the native state of a protein by destabilizing the unfolded state, 
thus compensating for the energetically unfavourable ‘folded’ conformation
PEG is a straight-chain polymer containing simple repeating subunits; PEG 1 kDa, used in the present study, has repeating units and is best modelled as a spherical particle
PEG and other crowding agents can increase the rate of enzymatic reactions,  alter reaction products, protect macromolecules from thermal denaturation, accelerate protein folding and facilitate nucleic acids renaturation
PEG also induces precipitation of proteins at high concentration (30%) and is used in protein purification
